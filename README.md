In this code I used MediaPipe framework(by Google) to make a simple hand detection program. 
The detection is real-time processed. In this case, it is made using the webcam. Also, as a lot of Machine Learning projects, I used OpenCV for video processing.
IMPORTANT! Pressing the "X" on the window won't close the execution. For that, you have the code for pressing "q" to close. You can change it to whatever you want.
Enjoy! ^_^
